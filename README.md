## Why RulingSafe Exists

RulingSafe started from a real-world problem.

I watched my father — a practicing lawyer — struggle with managing court rulings using
Excel files, scattered folders, and browser bookmarks. Over time, it became difficult
to keep documents, links, and case history organized in one place.

Many legal professionals face the same issue, especially those from non-technical
backgrounds. Existing solutions were either expensive, cloud-dependent, or overly complex.

**RulingSafe was built to solve this exact problem** —  
simple, offline, and designed around how legal professionals already work.
